We introduced the \gls{spade} approach with parallelization as a structured \gls{ibc} (co-) design flow. 
The presented \gls{spade} approach considers sensing-application parallelism, workload variations, platform settings, and control parameters for an efficient design and implementation of an \gls{ibc} system.
Our \gls{spade} approach optimises control quality and maximises the effective resource utilisation for a given platform allocation.
We demonstrate the applicability of \gls{spade} for both a predictable multiprocessor platform and for an industrial platform.
Though application timing is difficult to predict in  industrial platforms, we show that we can leverage existing predictable dataflow model-based design methods by carefully co-designing the sensing implementation and the (switched) controller design using system scenarios.
