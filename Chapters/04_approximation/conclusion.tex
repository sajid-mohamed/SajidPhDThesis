We have shown that compute-centric (\gls{isp} stage skipping) and data-centric (variable lossy compression) approximations are promising strategies for simultaneously optimizing \gls{qoc} and memory usage of \gls{ibc} systems. We have shown with extensive experiments that approximation-aware control designs are suitable when we take into account the artefacts of approximation in closed-loop systems while optimizing for \gls{qoc}. 
Our design approach is shown to be applicable to a wide range of environmental scenarios. The best results are obtained when switching between different controller configurations (system scenarios) when environmental conditions change.
We have also shown that approximate \gls{ibc} systems designed using our approach are robust with a \acrlong{fp} (FP per km) of 9.6 Ã— $10^{-6}$\%. 
The presented approximation approach is shown to have high potential in a \gls{lkas}. Approximating the sensing task is complementary to the parallelisation and pipelining discussed in earlier chapters. The dynamic switching between environmental scenarios fits well in the scenario-based \gls{spade} approach.
