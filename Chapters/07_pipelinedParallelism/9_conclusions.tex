\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:ch7_conclusion}
We have presented the \gls{spade} flow for \gls{ibc} system implementation that considers both pipelining and parallelism in an integral fashion to improve \gls{qoc} of multiprocessor \gls{ibc} implementations. 
We propose model transformations for modelling, analyzing and mapping the \gls{ibc} system.
We explain how the \gls{spade} approach can explicitly take into account inter-frame dependencies in pipelining, image workload variations, application parallelism, resource sharing, camera frame rate and a given platform allocation. 
We validate the \gls{spade} approach using Matlab simulations considering the predictable \gls{compsoc} platform and using hardware-in-the-loop experiments with an NVIDIA AGX Xavier platform.
We observe that considering pipelined parallelism has inherent advantages over considering pipelining and parallelism separately. Exploiting parallelism should be prioritized over pipelining. But pipelined parallelism is better when an application has a limited degree of parallelism or when the inter-frame dependencies are significant.
Future work may involve exploring the optimal degree of pipelining and parallelism when multiple \gls{ibc} systems are sharing a platform.
