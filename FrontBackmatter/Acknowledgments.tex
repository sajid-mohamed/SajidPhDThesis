\emph{I take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the fantastic people who have come across my life and whose actions impacted me positively, knowingly or unknowingly.}

This PhD, for me, has been a positive life-changing roller coaster ride full of ups and downs. The PhD journey reinvigorated my childhood inquisitiveness and critical thinking that had been mellowed down with my conditioned education. This journey showed me the fruitfulness of patience, perseverance and dedication, a journey that taught me directness, time management, and prioritisation and instilled in me confidence, courage and passion for innovation. All this would not have been possible without the help of numerous extraordinary individuals in my life.
